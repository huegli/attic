Removed stale Attic.xcodeproj\n2. Flattened AtticCore directory structure (moved all .swift files from subdirectories to Sources/AtticCore/ root) to work around Xcode 26 bug with subdirectory discovery\n3. Updated Package.swift comments\n\nBoth swift build and xcodebuild now succeed.","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"nikolai.schlegel@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:22:03.57739-08:00","created_by":"Nikolai Schlegel","updated_at":"2026-01-19T21:44:39.969421-08:00"}
