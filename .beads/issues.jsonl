{"id":"attic-09d","title":"MCP server for direct emulator access from Claude Code","description":"## Motivation\n\nDuring debugging of keyboard injection (attic-8qi, attic-ahr), direct access to the emulator from Claude Code would have significantly accelerated troubleshooting. Currently, debugging requires:\n\n1. Running AtticServer and CLI as separate processes\n2. Using CLI commands to inspect memory (slow, indirect)\n3. Manually decoding values (screen codes, BASIC pointers)\n4. Switching modes just to check state\n5. No ability to step frames and inspect state interactively\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nCreate an MCP server that exposes EmulatorEngine capabilities directly to Claude Code.\n\n## Suggested Tools\n\n### Memory Operations\n- `emulator_read_memory(address, count)` - Read bytes from emulator memory\n- `emulator_write_memory(address, bytes)` - Write bytes to memory\n- `emulator_read_word(address)` - Read 16-bit little-endian value\n\n### CPU State\n- `emulator_get_registers()` - Get PC, A, X, Y, SP, status flags\n- `emulator_set_registers(pc?, a?, x?, y?, sp?)` - Modify registers\n\n### Frame Control\n- `emulator_execute_frames(count)` - Run N frames\n- `emulator_step()` - Execute single frame with full state return\n\n### Input\n- `emulator_press_key(keyCode, shift?, control?)` - Simulate key press\n- `emulator_release_key()` - Release current key\n- `emulator_inject_string(text)` - Type a string (for testing)\n\n### Display\n- `emulator_get_screen()` - Get screen as text (decoded from screen codes)\n- `emulator_get_screen_raw()` - Get raw screen memory bytes\n\n### BASIC State\n- `emulator_get_basic_state()` - Return BASIC pointers (STMTAB, STARP, VNTP, etc.)\n- `emulator_list_program()` - Get current BASIC program listing\n\n### Emulator Control\n- `emulator_reset(cold?)` - Reset emulator\n- `emulator_get_status()` - Get run state, PC, frame count\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Faster debugging** - Direct inspection without CLI overhead\n2. **Interactive exploration** - Step through frames, check state, adjust\n3. **Automated testing** - Claude can write and run emulator tests\n4. **Better understanding** - See exactly what libatari800 is doing\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Could extend existing AtticServer or be a separate lightweight server\n- Should connect to running EmulatorEngine instance\n- Consider read-only vs read-write tool separation for safety\n- May want to expose as both MCP tools and CLI commands for flexibility\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- attic-ahr: Keyboard injection debugging would have been much easier\n- attic-0vu: Memory injection debugging would benefit\n- attic-8qi: Testing different injection approaches interactively","notes":"## Specific Debugging Tasks That Would Have Been Easier\n\n### From attic-ahr debugging session:\n\n1. **Checking CH register repeatedly**\n   - Did: Run CLI, type command, parse output\n   - With MCP: `emulator_read_memory(0x02FC, 1)` inline\n\n2. **Comparing screen state before/after**\n   - Did: Multiple read commands, manual decode of screen codes\n   - With MCP: `emulator_get_screen()` returns readable text\n\n3. **Testing different keyCode values**\n   - Did: Edit code, rebuild, restart server, run test\n   - With MCP: `emulator_press_key(0x1F)`, `emulator_execute_frames(5)`, check state\n\n4. **Verifying frame execution**\n   - Did: Add print statements, rebuild, check server output\n   - With MCP: `emulator_step()` returns frame result and state\n\n5. **Checking BASIC pointers**\n   - Did: Switch to monitor, read each address, mentally calculate\n   - With MCP: `emulator_get_basic_state()` returns structured data\n\n### Estimated time savings: 60-70% of debugging time","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"nikolai.schlegel@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-03T10:45:01.837293-08:00","created_by":"Nikolai Schlegel","updated_at":"2026-02-03T22:53:28.120218-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-03T22:53:28.120218-08:00","close_reason":"Socket discovery fixed - MCP server now discovers running AtticServer via discoverSocket() instead of using hardcoded PID-based path"}

Memory gets corrupted by concurrent modification.\n\n## Fixes Applied\n\n1. Restructured `injectLine()` to add variables BEFORE calculating position\n2. Added `guard shouldRun else { return .ok }` to `executeFrame()` to actually stop execution when paused\n\n## Files Modified\n\n- `Sources/AtticCore/BASICLineHandler.swift` - Fixed variable/position ordering\n- `Sources/AtticCore/EmulatorEngine.swift` - Added pause check to executeFrame()","notes":"### Debugging Session 2026-02-03\n\n**Major progress:** Identified root cause of GUI hang after CLI line injection.\n\n#### Key Discovery: `initializeBASICMemory` Was Corrupting BASIC's State\n\nWhen CLI enters a line and MEMTOP appears too low ($0804), we were calling `initializeBASICMemory` which reset ALL BASIC pointers:\n- Changed STMTAB from $0801 to $0701\n- Changed VNTP/VNTD/VVTP accordingly\n- This corrupted BASIC's view of where its program storage is\n\nBASIC had set up its own memory layout:\n- VNTP=$0800, VNTD=$0800, VVTP=$0801, STMTAB=$0801\n- This is different from what we were forcing ($0700/$0700/$0701/$0701)\n\n#### PC Trace Evidence\n\nWhen the hang occurred:\n- Before Return: PC=$F2FD-$F310 (OS keyboard input loop - normal)\n- After Return: PC=$A9B6-$A9DB (stuck in BASIC ROM execution loop)\n- STMCUR changed to $070E (pointing past our corrupted program area)\n\n#### Fix Applied\n\nChanged `initializeBASICMemory` call to only fix MEMTOP and RUNSTK, leaving all other pointers (STMTAB, VNTP, VVTP, etc.) as BASIC set them:\n\n```swift\n// Only fix MEMTOP and RUNSTK - leave all other pointers alone!\nawait emulator.writeWord(at: BASICPointers.memtop, value: memtop)\nawait emulator.writeWord(at: BASICPointers.runstk, value: memtop)\n```\n\n#### Result\n\n- **BASIC no longer hangs!** It responds to input again\n- PC returns to keyboard input loop after processing\n- But now get \"ERROR- 2\" (Out of memory) when typing immediate commands in GUI\n\n#### Remaining Issue\n\nThe \"Out of memory\" error suggests there's still some memory-related state that needs attention:\n- Possibly APPMHI ($0A-0B) needs to be updated\n- Possibly other cached values in BASIC's zero page\n- The injection itself may be putting data at wrong location given BASIC's actual layout\n\n#### Files Modified This Session\n\n- `Sources/AtticCore/BASICLineHandler.swift` - Conservative MEMTOP/RUNSTK fix only\n- `Sources/AtticServer/AtticServer.swift` - Added debug output for PC, STMTAB, STARP, STMCUR\n\n#### Next Steps\n\n1. Debug why \"Out of memory\" occurs - check if STARP is being updated correctly\n2. Verify injected line is at correct address given BASIC's STMTAB=$0801\n3.

{"id":"attic-3x1","title":"RUN command does not capture or return BASIC program output","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen using the `run` command in the CLI, the emulator starts executing the BASIC program but just returns \"Running\" - no program output is captured or displayed to the user. The program runs in the background with output going to the emulator screen buffer, which is not accessible from the CLI.\n\n## Current Implementation\n\n### BASICLineHandler.runProgram() (lines 501-520)\n\n```swift\npublic func runProgram() async -\u003e BASICLineResult {\n    let state = await readMemoryState()\n    \n    // Check if there is a program\n    let firstLineNum = await emulator.readWord(at: state.stmtab)\n    if firstLineNum == 0 {\n        return .error(\"No program to run\")\n    }\n    \n    // Reset STMCUR to start of program\n    await emulator.writeWord(at: BASICPointers.stmcur, value: state.stmtab)\n    \n    // Resume emulator\n    await emulator.resume()\n    \n    return .immediate(\"Running\")  // ← USER GETS NO OUTPUT!\n}\n```\n\nThe command:\n1. Sets STMCUR to the start of the program (correct)\n2. Resumes the emulator (correct)\n3. Returns \"Running\" immediately (problem!)\n\n### AtticServer handler (lines 561-567)\n\n```swift\ncase .basicRun:\n    let result = await basicHandler.runProgram()\n    if result.success {\n        return .ok(result.message)  // Just returns \"Running\"\n    } else {\n        return .error(result.message)\n    }\n```\n\n## What Is Missing\n\n1. **No screen text extraction** - The emulator only provides pixel-level frame buffers (BGRA format), not text. There is no mechanism to read the text content from the Atari display memory.\n\n2. **No execution waiting** - The command returns immediately without waiting for the program to complete.\n\n3. **No completion detection** - There is no way to detect when a BASIC program has finished executing (END statement, error, BREAK, etc.)\n\n4. **No output buffering** - Even if we could extract screen text, there is no mechanism to buffer the output as the program runs.\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n### Option A: Screen Memory Text Extraction\n\nRead Atari GRAPHICS 0 (text mode) screen RAM and decode ATASCII characters:\n- Screen RAM is at $4000-$5FFF (or pointed to by SAVMSC at $58-$59)\n- GRAPHICS 0 screen is 40 columns x 24 rows\n- Characters are ATASCII codes (need conversion to ASCII)\n- Would need to poll/sample periodically during program execution\n\n### Option B: CIO Hook/Redirection\n\nHook the Atari Central Input/Output (CIO) system to intercept PRINT output:\n- Intercept CIO calls to the screen device (E:)\n- Buffer all output characters as they are written\n- More accurate but requires deeper emulator integration\n\n### Option C: BASIC Output Vector Hook\n\nHook into BASIC interpreter output vector:\n- Monitor output through the BASIC runtime\n- May miss direct POKEs to screen memory\n\n### Option D: Hybrid Approach\n\n1. For immediate feedback: Return \"Running\" immediately (current behavior)\n2. Add a new \"output\" command that reads current screen text\n3. Add a \"wait\" command that blocks until program completes\n4. Optionally add background monitoring that sends output updates\n\n## Recommended Implementation\n\n**Phase 1 (Minimal):**\n1. Implement screen text extraction from GRAPHICS 0 memory\n2. Add to `EmulatorEngine` as `getScreenText() -\u003e String`\n3. Add new CLI command `output` or modify `run` to optionally wait and capture\n\n**Phase 2 (Enhanced):**\n1. Detect program completion (monitor STMCUR for return to immediate mode)\n2. Add timeout for long-running programs\n3. Support Ctrl+C to interrupt running programs\n\n## Files That Would Need Changes\n\n- `Sources/AtticCore/EmulatorEngine.swift` - Add screen text extraction\n- `Sources/AtticCore/BASICLineHandler.swift` - Modify `runProgram()` to optionally wait/capture\n- `Sources/AtticServer/AtticServer.swift` - Update `basicRun` handler\n- `Sources/AtticCore/CLIProtocol.swift` - May need new command types\n- `Sources/AtticCore/LibAtari800Wrapper.swift` - Low-level screen memory access\n\n## Atari Memory References\n\n- SAVMSC ($58-$59): Screen memory base address pointer\n- GRAPHICS 0 default screen: 40x24 characters = 960 bytes\n- ATASCII: Atari-specific character encoding (different from ASCII)\n- LMARGN ($52): Left margin\n- RMARGN ($53): Right margin\n- ROWCRS ($54): Current cursor row\n- COLCRS ($55-$56): Current cursor column","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"nikolai.schlegel@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-02T17:00:38.590472-08:00","created_by":"Nikolai Schlegel","updated_at":"2026-02-02T17:02:41.716475-08:00"}

The '1664' looks like a memory address or garbage line number, and 'LIST NEW' appears to be literal text that was injected incorrectly.\n\nPossible causes:\n- Race condition between CLI and GUI keyboard handling\n- Keyboard injection not properly tokenizing/handling input\n- Memory corruption during key event processing","notes":"## Revert\n\nThe attempted fix (key event queue with minimum hold time) did not solve the issue.

Start AtticServer\n2. Use enter_basic_line to enter a program:\n   - 10 REM TEST\n3. Inject 'LIST' + RETURN via keyboard (press_key or GUI)\n4.

This means:\n- BASIC's cursor position is not updated\n- Input buffer state is unknown\n- Screen state doesn't show READY prompt properly\n- BASIC may not be in 'immediate mode' ready to accept commands\n\nWhen keyboard input is then injected, BASIC is in an inconsistent state and misinterprets the input.\n\nNote: The program memory itself is NOT corrupted (list_basic via CLI protocol shows correct program). The issue is purely about BASIC interpreter state synchronization.\n\n## Possible Fixes\n1. After enter_basic_line, execute frames to let BASIC return to READY state\n2.

{"id":"attic-8qi","title":"Replace direct memory injection with keyboard injection for BASIC line entry","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current approach of writing tokenized BASIC code directly into emulator memory (attic-0vu) is fundamentally flawed. Memory layout changes when variables are introduced, string storage moves, and the BASIC interpreter's internal state becomes desynchronized.\n\n## Proposed Solution: Keyboard Injection\n\nSimulate keystrokes as if the user typed the BASIC code. The emulator's built-in BASIC interpreter handles tokenization naturally.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Uses the real BASIC interpreter - guaranteed correct behavior\n- No memory layout synchronization issues\n- Handles all edge cases (variables, strings, line renumbering)\n\n**Cons:**\n- Slower than direct memory writes (~50-100ms per line)\n- Need to handle timing (wait for interpreter ready)\n\n## Investigation Findings\n\n### Existing Infrastructure\n\n**Single key injection already works:**\n```swift\n// EmulatorEngine.swift:413-420\npublic func pressKey(keyChar: UInt8, keyCode: UInt8, shift: Bool = false, control: Bool = false)\npublic func releaseKey()\n```\n\n**AESP protocol supports keyboard:**\n- `keyDown` (0x40) - Key press with modifiers\n- `keyUp` (0x41) - Release current key\n- Messages defined in AESPMessage.swift:534-549\n\n**Key latching mechanism exists** (EmulatorEngine.swift:106-110):\n- Keys held for at least one frame before release\n- Prevents missed keystrokes\n\n### What's Missing\n\n1. **No keyboard queue/buffer** - Only one key active at a time\n2. **No string injection API** - No method to send \"10 PRINT HELLO\" as a string\n3. **No timing management** - Must manually wait between keystrokes\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Core String Injection\n\nAdd to EmulatorEngine.swift:\n```swift\n/// Injects a string of characters as keyboard input\n/// - Parameter text: The text to inject (e.g., \"10 PRINT HELLO\")\n/// - Parameter delayMs: Milliseconds between keystrokes (default 50)\npublic func injectString(_ text: String, delayMs: Int = 50) async {\n    for char in text {\n        let (keyChar, keyCode, shift, control) = mapCharToAtariKey(char)\n        await pressKey(keyChar: keyChar, keyCode: keyCode, shift: shift, control: control)\n        try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(delayMs) * 1_000_000)\n        await releaseKey()\n        try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(delayMs) * 1_000_000)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Phase 2: BASIC Line Injection\n\nAdd to REPLEngine or BASICLineHandler:\n```swift\n/// Injects a BASIC line via keyboard simulation\n/// - Parameter line: The BASIC line (e.g., \"10 PRINT HELLO\")\npublic func injectBASICLine(_ line: String) async throws {\n    // 1. Inject the line text\n    await emulator.injectString(line)\n    // 2. Press RETURN to enter the line\n    await emulator.pressKey(keyChar: 0, keyCode: AKEY_RETURN)\n    await emulator.releaseKey()\n    // 3.

Remove BASICLineHandler memory injection code\n2. Remove related memory address calculations\n3. Close attic-0vu as superseded\n\n## Key Files\n\n| File | Changes Needed |\n|------|----------------|\n| Sources/AtticCore/EmulatorEngine.swift | Add injectString(), mapCharToAtariKey() |\n| Sources/AtticCore/KeyboardInputHandler.swift | Reference for key mapping constants |\n| Sources/AtticCore/REPLEngine.swift | Update BASIC line handling to use injection |\n| Sources/AtticProtocol/AESPMessage.swift | Add injectString message type |\n| Sources/AtticProtocol/AESPClient.swift | Add sendInjectString() method |\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Single character injection (A-Z, 0-9, symbols)\n2. Full BASIC line: `10 PRINT \"HELLO WORLD\"`\n3. Multi-line program injection\n4. Special characters and control codes\n5.

Using ATASCII in keychar with keycode=0xFF (like GUI does)\n2. Using internal key codes in keycode field\n3. Adding usleep delays between frames\n4. Increasing frames per character and wait times\n\nThe GUI keyboard input works correctly, so there's something different about how input is processed in the GUI's continuous runLoop vs our programmatic frame execution.\n\nThis blocks attic-8qi.

Even when we manually set these registers, the IRQ is never serviced\n\nThe Atari screen editor checks SKSTAT to detect key presses. Since libatari800 doesn't update SKSTAT, the screen editor never sees the key as pressed and doesn't read CH.\n\nTESTING PERFORMED:\n- Verified CH IS set by libatari800 when keys are injected\n- Verified KBCODE and SKSTAT are NOT updated\n- Manually wrote to KBCODE/SKSTAT - IRQ still not triggered\n- Ran 120+ frames with IRQ pending (IRQST=0x29) - never serviced\n\nWORKAROUND:\nUse enter_basic_line which bypasses keyboard entirely and writes directly to BASIC memory.

{"id":"attic-bvw","title":"BASIC memory not initialized correctly on fresh server start","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen entering BASIC lines immediately after connecting to AtticServer, you get an \"Out of memory\" error even for simple one-line programs like `10 REM HELLO`.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nIn `AtticServer.swift` lines 702-763, the startup sequence is:\n\n```swift\n// Line 706\ntry await emulator.initialize(romPath: romPath)\n// ...server setup...\n// Line 763\nawait emulator.resume()\n```\n\n**The problem:** `initialize()` only calls `libatari800_init()` which loads ROMs but does NOT run the Atari boot sequence. The boot sequence is what initializes BASIC memory pointers.\n\nWithout running the boot sequence:\n- MEMTOP ($90-$91) is set to garbage/default value like $0804\n- RUNSTK ($8E-$8F) is also uninitialized\n- The memory check `newStarp \u003e Int(state.runstk) - 256` fails immediately\n\n## The Fix Is Simple\n\nIn `AtticServer.swift`, after `initialize()`, add a cold reset:\n\n```swift\ntry await emulator.initialize(romPath: romPath)\nawait emulator.reset(cold: true)  // \u003c-- ADD THIS LINE\nprint(\"Emulator initialized successfully\")\n```\n\nThe `reset(cold: true)` method already:\n1. Calls `wrapper.reboot(with: nil)` to trigger boot\n2. Runs 150 frames to complete boot sequence (~2.5 seconds worth)\n3. Calls `clearBASICProgram()` which reads RAMTOP ($6A) and properly initializes all BASIC pointers\n\n## Why .reset Command Works As Workaround\n\nWhen you run `.reset` in the CLI, it triggers `reset(cold: true)` which properly initializes BASIC memory. That is why BASIC lines work after a reset.\n\n## Memory Pointer Details\n\nThe `clearBASICProgram()` function in `EmulatorEngine.swift:224-254` properly initializes:\n- VNTP ($82-$83): Variable Name Table Pointer\n- VNTD ($84-$85): Variable Name Table Dummy End  \n- VVTP ($86-$87): Variable Value Table Pointer\n- STMTAB ($88-$89): Statement Table\n- STMCUR ($8A-$8B): Current Statement Pointer\n- STARP ($8C-$8D): String/Array Table Pointer\n- RUNSTK ($8E-$8F): Runtime Stack Pointer (set to MEMTOP)\n- MEMTOP ($90-$91): Top of BASIC memory\n\nIt reads RAMTOP ($6A) which IS correctly set by libatari800, then uses that to calculate proper BASIC memory layout.\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n- `Sources/AtticServer/AtticServer.swift` line ~706: Add `await emulator.reset(cold: true)` after initialize\n\n## Alternative Fix Location\n\nCould also modify `EmulatorEngine.initialize()` to automatically run boot sequence and initialize BASIC memory, but that would change behavior for all clients (GUI might want to handle boot differently).","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"nikolai.schlegel@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-01T19:50:52.04036-08:00","created_by":"Nikolai Schlegel","updated_at":"2026-02-02T17:29:41.224661-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T17:29:41.224661-08:00","close_reason":"Added cold reset after emulator.initialize() in AtticServer.swift to run boot sequence and initialize BASIC memory pointers"}

Tests cover toggle behavior, directional input, fire button, diagonal movement, reset handling, and interaction with normal keyboard input.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Build AtticGUI: swift build\n- Have a joystick-controlled game disk image (e.g. Star Raiders, Pac-Man, or any game using joystick port 0)\n- Test in both Client mode (AtticServer + AtticGUI) and Embedded mode (AtticGUI --embedded)\n\n## Test Cases\n\n### 1. Menu Toggle\n- [ ] Emulator \u003e Joystick Emulation menu item visible\n- [ ] Cmd+J toggles the checkmark on/off\n- [ ] Menu shows checkmark when enabled, no checkmark when disabled\n\n### 2. Basic Directions (joystick emulation ON)\n- [ ] Up arrow moves joystick up\n- [ ] Down arrow moves joystick down\n- [ ] Left arrow moves joystick left\n- [ ] Right arrow moves joystick right\n- [ ] Releasing each arrow key returns to neutral\n\n### 3. Fire Button\n- [ ] Spacebar triggers fire (joystick button)\n- [ ] Releasing spacebar releases fire\n\n### 4. Diagonal Movement\n- [ ] Hold Up + Right simultaneously -\u003e diagonal up-right\n- [ ] Hold Down + Left simultaneously -\u003e diagonal down-left\n- [ ] Release one direction while holding the other -\u003e single direction continues\n- [ ] All four arrows held then released one by one -\u003e correct transitions\n\n### 5. Normal Keyboard Pass-Through\n- [ ] Non-mapped keys (letters, numbers, F-keys) still work as Atari keyboard input while joystick emulation is on\n- [ ] F5 still triggers warm reset while joystick emulation is on\n\n### 6. Toggle Off Resets State\n- [ ] Hold an arrow key, then Cmd+J to toggle off -\u003e joystick returns to neutral (no stuck direction)\n- [ ] After toggling off, arrow keys work as normal Atari cursor keys again\n- [ ] Spacebar works as normal Atari space key after toggling off\n\n### 7. Reset Clears Joystick\n- [ ] Hold a direction, perform Cold Reset (Cmd+Shift+R) -\u003e joystick resets to neutral\n- [ ] Hold a direction, perform Warm Reset (Cmd+Option+R) -\u003e joystick resets to neutral\n- [ ] Hold a direction, press F5 (warm reset) -\u003e joystick resets to neutral\n\n### 8. Client Mode vs Embedded Mode\n- [ ] All above tests pass in Client mode (AtticServer running, AtticGUI connects)\n- [ ] All above tests pass in Embedded mode (AtticGUI --embedded)\n\n### 9. Game Playability\n- [ ] Load a joystick game, enable joystick emulation, play for 30+ seconds\n- [ ] Directional response feels immediate (no noticeable lag)\n- [ ] Fire button response feels immediate\n- [ ] Diagonal movement works smoothly in-game","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"nikolai.schlegel@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T13:00:50.903857-08:00","created_by":"Nikolai Schlegel","updated_at":"2026-02-06T13:12:28.517312-08:00"}
