Make an icon as following: A high-resolution 1024x1024 pixel art icon of a cardboard box from an isometric perspective. The icon should be on a clean, transparent background. The box is made of brown cardboard with visible pixel shading to give it texture and a 3D feel. It is slightly open, and peeking out from the opening is the top portion of the classic red-orange Atari "Fuji" logo. The Atari logo should be clearly recognizable, with its three distinct stripes. The entire icon must have a charming, blocky, 8-bit aesthetic with sharp, clean pixels, in the style of a modern video game sprite or application icon.
